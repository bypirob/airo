# üöÄ Airo

**Deploy your projects directly from your local computer to your production server easily.**

Airo helps you deploying containers to your self-hosted server, without worrying about configuring pipelines, serverless services or different platforms. Just your self-hosted servers.

## Why Airo?

Deploying side-projects doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Kubernetes, Platform as a Service (PaaS) and CI/CD pipelines are a powerful and exciting solutions, but sometimes they're more complex than your project requires. If you enjoy managing your server, it can be significantly cheaper and offer greater control over the technical details.

I want to automate this process and deploy easily to my own server. That's why I've created **Airo**:

- üöÄ **Focus on building your product**, not managing infrastructure.
- üê≥ **Build and push Docker images directly from your local machine to a container registry**.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Deploy instantly** with a single command from your computer.
- üîë **Easily update configurations and containers securely** using SSH.
- üåê **Set up HTTPS and reverse proxy automatically** using Caddy.

## How It Works

Deploying with Airo is easy:

1. Define your services in a `compose.yml` file.
2. Configure your deployment details in `env.yml` (server details, Docker images, etc.).
3. Prepare your Dockerfile.
4. Set up your Caddyfile for automatic HTTPS and reverse proxy.

After this initial setup, deploying new updates is just a simple command away:

```bash
airo deploy
```

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/airo.git
cd airo
make install
airo deploy
```

## Usage

### Initial Server Setup

If you have a fresh server that doesn't have Docker installed yet, you can use the `init` command to set everything up:

```bash
airo init
```

This command will:

- Update all system packages
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Add your user to the docker group
- Verify the installation

**Note:** After running `init`, you may need to log out and back in to the server for docker group permissions to take effect.

### Deploying Your Application

1. Create a new project directory and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-project/.deploy
   cd my-project/.deploy
   ```

2. Configure your `env.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   server: your-server-ip
   user: your-ssh-user
   ssh_key: /path/to/your/ssh/key
   # add all your services that will be built here
   services:
     - name: nextjs
       image: your-registry/api:latest
       build: /home/user/your-project
   ```

3. Add a Dockerfile to your project:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:20-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . .
   RUN npm install
   ```

4. Configure your `compose.yml` file with your services:

   ```yaml
   services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:latest
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - '5432:5432'
        volumes:
          - ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
        environment:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: some-temporary-password
     nextjs:
       image: your-registry/front:latest
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - '3000:3000'
       volumes:
         - ./.env:/app/.env
   ```

5. Deploy your project:
   ```bash
   airo deploy
   ```

### Additional Commands

- **Update compose configuration without building images:**

  ```bash
  airo compose
  ```

- **Update Caddyfile configuration:**

  ```bash
  airo caddy
  ```

- **Initialize a fresh server (install Docker and updates):**
  ```bash
  airo init
  ```

### Custom Config Directory

By default, Airo looks for config files (`env.yml`, `compose.yml`, `Caddyfile`) in the current directory. You can specify a different directory using the `--config` flag:

```bash
airo deploy --config /path/to/config/directory
airo compose --config ./my-project/.deploy
airo caddy --config ../configs
airo init --config ./server-configs
```

This is useful when:

- You have multiple deployment configurations
- Your config files are in a different directory
- You want to organize your deployment files separately
